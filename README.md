# ðŸ˜Ž Face Detection & Recognition System (DeepFace)

A real-time face detection and recognition system built using Python and DeepFace. The system captures faces from a webcam, compares them with known images, and displays or logs the result.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project uses the DeepFace library to detect and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam. It leverages deep learning models (like VGG-Face, Facenet, etc.) for high-accuracy face recognition.

You can use it to:
- Detect faces live from webcam
- Recognize known people from a stored database
- Compare face similarity
- Optionally record attendance (extensible)

## ðŸ§  Features

- Real-time webcam feed using OpenCV
- Face detection and recognition using DeepFace
- Match faces with stored dataset
- Displays matched name with confidence score
- Optionally extensible to mark attendance/logs
